## Getting Help Exercise

- There is a command called `whoami`.  **Before you run it**, read the manual page entry on it.  
    From the manual page entry, can you tell if it needs any options or arguments? What does it do?  
- Now try running it! What happens?
- There is another command called `who`.  Without turning to Google, figure out what it does!   
    Does it require any arguments or options to run?
- Use the `who` command to print out the time of the most recent system boot.  You'll need to find   
    an option to help you do this!
- Run a command to figure out whether the `echo` command is a binary, a shell-built in, or an alias.
- Do the same for  the `date` command
