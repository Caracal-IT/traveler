# Navigating

Navigating the file system is a fundamental task in Linux.   
The `cd` command is used to change the current working directory, allowing you to move   
between directories and access files and subdirectories.

## Folder Structure

Linux uses a hierarchical file system structure, starting from the root directory (`/`). 
This structure allows for a clear organization of files and directories, making it easier to   
manage and locate resources.  

The root directory (`/`) is the top-level directory and contains all other directories and files.   
Subdirectories are created within the root directory or other directories, forming a tree-like structure.   
Each directory can contain files and subdirectories, creating a nested hierarchy.

### Important Folders

1. / - root directory
2. etc - system configuration files
3. usr - user programs and libraries
4. bin - executable programs
5. boot - boot files
6. dev - device files
7. **home** - user home directories (shortcut: ~)
8. lib - shared libraries
9. media - removable media files
10. mnt - mounted file systems
11. opt – optional application software
12. proc - process information
13. root – root directory
14. run - runtime files
15. sbin - system binaries
16. srv - service data

18. tmp – temporary files
