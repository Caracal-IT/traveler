# Redirection

In Linux, redirection is a powerful feature that allows you to control where the output of a command is sent and   
where input is taken from. It is achieved using special characters called redirection operators, which can   
redirect standard input (stdin), standard output (stdout), and standard error (stderr) to files, other commands,   
or even discard them. 

## Redirecting Output

The `>` operator redirects the output of a command to a file. If the file already exists, it will be overwritten. 
To append to an existing file instead of overwriting it, use the `>>` operator.

```bash
$ ls -l > file.txt
$ cat bees.txt ants.txt > insects.txt 2> error.txt
```

## Redirecting Input

The `<` operator redirects the input of a command from a file. If the file does not exist, the command will fail.

```bash
$ cat < file.txt
$ cat file.txt < input.txt
$ cat < orriginal.txt > modified.txt
```

## Redirecting Error Output

The `2>` operator redirects the error output of a command to a file. If the file already exists, it will be overwritten. 
To append to an existing file instead of overwriting it, use the `2>>` operator.

```bash
$ ls -l 2> error.txt
$ ls -l 2>> error.txt
$ ls -l > output.txt 2>&1
```
