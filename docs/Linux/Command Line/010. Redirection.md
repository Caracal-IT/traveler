# Redirection

In Linux, redirection is a powerful feature that allows you to control where the output of a command is sent and   
where input is taken from. It is achieved using special characters called redirection operators, which can   
redirect standard input (stdin), standard output (stdout), and standard error (stderr) to files, other commands,   
or even discard them.
