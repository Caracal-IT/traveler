# Remove folders with -d and -r

To remove a folder with -d and -r, you need to add a / at the end of the folder name.  
The / tells the rm command to delete the contents of the folder, the -d flag tells it 
to delete empty folders, and the -r flag tells it to delete the folder and its contents   
recursively.
