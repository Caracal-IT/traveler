# The Sleeping Barber

- A classic computer science problem introduced by Edsger Dijkstra in 1965.
- A barber goes to work in a barbershop with a waiting room with a fixed number of chairs.
- If no one is in the barbershop, the barber goes to sleep.
- When a customer arrives, if there are no chairs available, he or she leaves.
- If there are chairs available, and the barber is asleep, the barber wakes up and starts cutting hair.
- If the barber is busy cutting hair, the customer waits until the barber is done.
- Once the shop closes, no more customers are allowed in, but the barber continues cutting hair until he or she is done.
- The barber can only cut one customer at a time.
